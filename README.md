ReviewAnalyzer (!<-тут повинна бути наша назва!) is a true innovation in the field of review analysis. It does an amazing job of classifying user reviews of medicines into three sentiment categories: Positive, Neutral and Negative. The model demonstrates near-state-of-the-art results on high-quality data, allowing you to quickly and accurately understand user opinions.

## Data

The original dataset provided to us consisted of databases containing user reviews of medications. The dataset included several columns: patient_id, drugName, condition, review, rating, date, usefulCount, and reviewCount. Additionally, in response to our request, we were provided with a more detailed set of reviews. This allowed us to better analyze and fine-tune our model for sentiment classification, ensuring accuracy in distinguishing between Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiments.
