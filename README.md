# Sentiment Analysis of Drug Reviews
***
## Brief description

Building a machine learning model to classify user reviews of medicines into three sentiment categories: Positive, Neutral, and Negative.
Tasks:

- Collecting and cleaning review data.

- Data preprocessing: tokenization, lemmatization, and text vectorization.

- Developing and training a machine learning model to detect sentiment.

- Evaluating and optimizing the model to improve classification accuracy.

The goal of the project is to automate the process of review analysis to quickly and accurately understand user opinions about medicines.

## Discover what our product is capable of
***
Our project was originally created for dividing drug reviews into three categories based on it's mood: Positive, Neutral and Negative. But we then decided to expand it so it now can give most popular side effects f0r each drug based on its review in database.
## Data

The original dataset provided to us consisted of databases containing user reviews of medications. The dataset included several columns: patient_id, drugName, condition, review, rating, date, usefulCount, and reviewCount. Additionally, in response to our request, we were provided with a more detailed set of reviews. This allowed us to better analyze and fine-tune our model for sentiment classification, ensuring accuracy in distinguishing between Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiments.
